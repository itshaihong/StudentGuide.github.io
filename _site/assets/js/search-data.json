    "content": "Satcat is a data aggregation platform for spaceflight safety, used by satellite operators to assess conjunction risk, maintain orbit custody, and coordinate maneuvers in an ever-growing congested space environment. Satcat combines operator-submitted ephemerides, commercial catalog data, and third party sensor networks to evaluate conjunction events and deliver data through APIs and standard file formats. ",

    "content": "2.1. Satellite Directory [Directory tab] . You can search for satellite directory here using satellite name/NORAD ID/COSPAR ID. It provides all related information for each traked satellite, including: . | Launcher &amp; manufacturer | Dimensions and other physical properties | Visibility | Orbit information: TLE data, Ephemerides | Conjuctions | etc… | . NORAD ID: The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) maintains the satellite catalog. Each tracked object is assigned a unique identifier known as the SATCAT number or NORAD ID. Two-Line Element (TLE) is a standard, text-based data format that concisely describes the orbit of an Earth-orbiting satellite or space object at a specific time (epoch). TLEs contain simplified Keplerian elements (like inclination, eccentricity, mean motion) plus drag/perturbation factors, allowing users to predict future positions and velocities using models like SGP4. Ephemeris is a table or dataset providing the predicted positions, velocities, and sometimes other data (like brightness) for satellites. There are 3 main types of files: OPM, OMM, and OEM. 2.2. Screening for Conjunctions [Screenings tab] . Screening allows you to submit a job to search for conjunctions providing a primary and/or secondary satellite. | Click one New Screening Job. | Enter a title for this screening job at Screening job title. | In the Primary RSOs field, you can search for the Ephemeris file of your primary satellites from the database, or upload your own Ephemeris file/TLE by clicking Upload custom data. | In the Secondary RSOs field, upload Ephemeris file for your secondary satellite in the same manner. If you don’t have a desired secondary satellite and want to do a general screening, you can tick the box of Screen 18th SDS catalog/Screen Ephemeris Repository, which will search through the database for all conjunctions related to primary satellite. | When done, click Start Screening job. | . Your screening job will appear as a box in panel with all the screening jobs. The update of search result is asychronous (other jobs can be carried out while one is running). You might observe the number of conjunctions detected keeps changing for a few minutes if the search space is big. When the job is finished, the top right conrner of your job will change to tick. Click into one of the screening job box to see all the found conjunctions. Click into one of the boxes of conjunctions will bring you to Conjunction tab. 2.3. Conjunction Information [Conjunctions tab] . Each conjunction has a series of information associated with it. Including propability of collision (Pc), time of closest approach (TCA), miss distances, etc… You can read these directly from the website or download the conjunction data message (CDM) file. 2.4. Other useful tools . | Sandbox tab: to visualize 2 satellites movements. Upload TLE, or Ephemeries files, or simply search for them in the Ephemeris database. Satcat can generate a 3D animation for 2 satellites’ orbit, as well as graphs for 2 satellites’ relative ranges. | Tools tab: time converter to convert timestamp across different formats, and TLE comprehension assistants to help you parse TLE and understand differnet segments. | .
