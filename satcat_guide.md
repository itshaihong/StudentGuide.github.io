# 🛰️ Guide to Using Satcat.com

This page provides guidelines and tips for effectively using the Satcat.com database to search for, track, and analyze satellite catalog data.

## 1. Understanding NORAD IDs (SATCAT)
The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) maintains the satellite catalog. Each tracked object is assigned a unique identifier known as the SATCAT number or NORAD ID.

* **Key Data Points:** When searching, you often look for the NORAD ID, International Designator, and Launch Date.

## 2. Searching and Filtering
Describe the main search features here: basic search by name, advanced filtering by launch year, orbit type, etc.

* **Example Query:** Search for the International Space Station (ISS) using its NORAD ID (25544) or name.

## 3. Retrieving TLE Data
Two-Line Element (TLE) sets are the standard format for communicating orbital state vectors. You will usually retrieve these from Satcat.com.

* **Format:** TLEs are composed of two 69-character lines of data (plus an optional header line).
* **Usage:** TLEs are essential for performing orbit propagation (predicting future position).

## 4. Visualizing Orbits
(Describe any built-in visualization tools Satcat.com might have, or how to export data for external tools like GMAT or Python libraries.)
